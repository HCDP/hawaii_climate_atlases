        The 2011 Rainfall Atlas of Hawai‘i was developed under an agreement between the State of Hawai‘i Commission on Water 
        Resource Management and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District under Section 22 of the Water Resources 
        Development Act of 1974.  Contract No. W9128A-04-D-0019, Contract Task Order No. 0038 was awarded to Wil Chee Planning, 
        Inc., which subcontracted the work to the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, Department of Geography.

        The development of the 2011 Rainfall Atlas of Hawai‘i was supported by numerous individuals and organizations. Please 
        refer to the People page for information about those who contributed to this work. We are grateful to the people listed 
        there, as well as the many other individuals who contributed to Hawai‘i’s rainfall dataset by carefully and consistently 
        making measurements and recording and preserving the data. Those records are an invaluable resource, without which no 
        rainfall map analysis would be possible.
